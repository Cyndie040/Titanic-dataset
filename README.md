# Titanic Dataset Dashboard

### Project Overview

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset and visualizes key insights through an interactive Excel-based dashboard. The dashboard provides a detailed view of survival patterns based on gender, class, age, family presence, and embarkation points.

### Dashboard Features

The dashboard includes the following key components:

- Total Revenue: Displays the total ticket revenue from passengers.

- Average Age: The mean age of all passengers onboard.

- Total Passengers: The total number of individuals aboard the Titanic.

- Family Aboard: The number of passengers traveling with family members.

- Total Passengers by Gender: A pie chart showing the proportion of male and female passengers.

- Survival Based on Age Group and Family: A bar chart analyzing survival rates based on age groups and family presence.

- Survival Based on Age Group and Gender: A bar chart visualizing survival rates among adults, children, and elderly passengers by gender.

- Survival Based on Embarkation: A bar chart showing survival rates based on embarkation locations.

- Survival Based on Gender: A bar chart illustrating male and female survival rates.

- Survival Based on Gender and Family: A bar chart depicting survival and mortality rates considering both gender and family presence.

### Tools Used

- Excel: For data visualization and dashboard creation.

- Pivot Tables & Charts: Used for data aggregation and visualization.

- Data Cleaning: Ensured accuracy in dataset before visualization.

📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains passenger details such as age, gender, class, fare, embarkation point, and survival status. You can access the dataset from Kaggle: Titanic Dataset.

🚀 How to Use the Dashboard
Open the Excel file containing the dashboard.

Use the filters on the left panel to refine the data by Passenger Class, Survival Status, Gender, and Embarkation Point.

Analyze key insights displayed in various charts and KPIs.

📈 Insights & Key Findings
Gender Disparity: A higher proportion of females survived compared to males.

Impact of Class: First-class passengers had higher survival rates than second and third-class passengers.

Family Presence: Passengers with family onboard had a higher chance of survival.

Embarkation Influence: The survival rate varied based on embarkation locations.

🔮 Future Improvements
Integrate Python for deeper data analysis and visualization.

Develop an interactive Power BI or Tableau version.

Enhance the dashboard with additional filtering options.
